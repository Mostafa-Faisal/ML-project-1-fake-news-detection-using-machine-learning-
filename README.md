# Fake News Detection Using Machine Learning

## üîç Project Overview

This project implements an AI-powered fake news detection system using advanced BERT-based Natural Language Processing techniques. The system analyzes news articles in real-time to determine their authenticity with high accuracy, helping users identify potentially misleading or false information.

## üöÄ Features

- **BERT Model Integration**: Utilizes state-of-the-art BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) for enhanced text analysis
- **Real-time Analysis**: Instant detection and classification of news articles
- **Deep Learning**: Advanced neural network architecture for pattern recognition
- **Web Interface**: User-friendly Flask-based web application
- **Confidence Scoring**: Provides probability scores for both real and fake news classifications
- **Analysis History**: Track previous analyses and view statistics
- **Pattern Analysis**: Detailed breakdown of suspicious patterns in articles
